# Database Guidelines

> Engine usage, query execution, and schema metadata conventions in this project.

---

## Engine and URL

- Async SQLAlchemy engine is created in `app/database/engine.py` from `Settings.database_url`.
- Default local development URL comes from `app/config.py` and is SQLite async.
- MySQL-style URLs are treated specially in engine config so charset/connect args can be applied.

---

## Execution Path

`app/database/executor.py` is the only approved execution path for user-generated SQL.

Real behavior in `SQLExecutor.execute()`:

1. `SQLValidator.validate_read_only(sql)` runs first
2. positional params are remapped to named SQLAlchemy params (`p0`, `p1`, ...)
3. SQL executes through `self.engine.connect()` and `connection.execute(text(sql), sql_params)`
4. optional timeout is enforced with `asyncio.wait_for(...)`
5. result rows are normalized into `SQLExecutionResult`

Do not execute model-generated SQL directly from a router, service, or RAG helper.

---

## Result Shape

`SQLExecutionResult` is the shared execution contract used by the agent layer. The executor returns:

- `rows`: list of JSON-serializable dictionaries
- `row_count`: count after any result cap is applied
- `columns`: ordered result keys
- `truncated`: whether the result was cut by limit
- `execution_summary`: user-facing summary text
- `execution_time_ms`: timing when available

Serialization rules in `SQLExecutor._serialize_value()`:

- `Decimal` → `float`
- `datetime` / `date` / `time` → ISO string
- `bytes` → UTF-8 string when decodable

---

## Limits and Timeouts

- Row cap comes from executor configuration and can be overridden per call with `max_rows`.
- `timeout_seconds` is optional per execution call.
- Timeout and SQLAlchemy failures return a structured `SQLExecutionResult`; they are not allowed to crash the API path by default.

---

## Schema Metadata and RAG

The live schema catalog is built in `app/rag/schema_sync.py` and cached in `app/services/rag_service.py`.

Real pattern from `_get_schema_catalog()`:

- cache key is `settings.database_url`
- TTL comes from `schema_cache_ttl_seconds`
- refresh can bypass cache
- cache access is protected by `_catalog_lock`

`RagService` is responsible for schema retrieval and plan construction, not for running SQL.

---

## Read-Only Policy

- Public query execution is read-only.
- Validator ownership stays in `app/validator/sql_validator.py`.
- Executor re-checks SQL before every execution, even if upstream nodes already validated it.

---

## Forbidden Patterns

- Bypassing `SQLExecutor` for NL2SQL output
- Bypassing `SQLValidator` because a previous graph node already ran validation
- Executing SQL inside `rag/` modules while doing schema retrieval or repair

---

## Common Mistakes

- Assuming parameter order is preserved as anonymous placeholders instead of the executor's `p0`, `p1` named mapping
- Forgetting that cache behavior in `RagService` depends on `database_url`, so tests touching schema metadata should isolate config carefully
